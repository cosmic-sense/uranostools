# uranostools
Tools for postprocessing of URANOS output

## Purpose
This repository contains a selection of Python scripts intended for postprocessing the output of the neutron model [URANOS](https://github.com/mkoehli/uranos). Their envisioned future is to be merged to [Corny](https://git.ufz.de/CRNS/cornish_pasdy) or Yulia.

## Source
The development forked off the contents of  [URANOS/analysis](https://github.com/mkoehli/uranos/tree/main/analysis) of 9 Mar 2023.

## Installation and dependencies
Some parts depend on [Corny](https://git.ufz.de/CRNS/cornish_pasdy), which needs to be installed alongside. 
[here goes an example where and how to adjust the path]
